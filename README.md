# üëã Hey there, I'm Yash Kumar Kasaudhan üëã

`whois`

A pragmatic polyglot and systems thinker, driven by a detective's curiosity to solve complex puzzles with code. I thrive on deconstructing problems to their first principles and building efficient, elegant solutions from the ground up. My playground is the command line; my core tools are C and JavaScript.

I am driven by the pursuit of knowledge and the joy of building. I'm less interested in following trends and more interested in understanding the fundamental "why" behind the technology I use.

### üìñ My Core Philosophy & Interests

My approach is simple: **observe, deduce, build.** I believe the most robust solutions come from a deep understanding of the problem space, not just the application of a framework.

*   **Systems-Level Curiosity:** I enjoy diving into low-level concepts, from how WebSockets work in C to optimizing data structures.
*   **The Craft of Code:** My goal is to achieve mastery in my chosen tools, treating software development as a craft that demands precision and continuous learning.
*   **Pragmatic Building:** I love building things from scratch‚Äîlike a single-page app with pure Node.js and C WebAssembly‚Äîto truly understand the technology, not just use it.
*   **Open Source Contributor:** I actively contribute to the open-source ecosystem, focusing on impactful projects in the Linux and GTK/GNOME space.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Engineering Domains & Focus

I am most passionate about challenges in these areas:

*   **Backend & Systems Programming:** Building efficient, scalable server-side logic and command-line tools.
*   **Desktop & Application Development:** Crafting applications within the Linux/GTK ecosystem.
*   **Automation & Tooling:** Creating tools that improve developer workflows and efficiency.
*   **Web Fundamentals:** Working with pure JavaScript/Node.js to understand and build for the web at a deeper level.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies I Wield and Explore

(`ORDER BY mastery DESC, interest ASC`):

*   **C & C++**
    *(For performance, systems-level understanding, and the challenge of precision)*
*   **JavaScript & Node.js**
    *(My tool for building for the modern web, with a preference for a pure, framework-less approach)*
*   **GTK & GLib/GObject**
    *(The foundation for my contributions to the GNOME desktop environment)*
*   **Linux & Shell Scripting**
    *(My native environment and the core of my workflow)*
*   **TypeScript**
    *(A language I am actively exploring to bring more structure and scalability to my web projects)*
*   **WebAssembly (Wasm)**
    *(To bridge the gap between the performance of C and the ubiquity of the web)*

I enjoy competitive programming (ICPC), building automation tools, and contributing to open-source projects that have a visible impact.

I am always open to connecting with fellow builders and problem-solvers. If you have a challenging problem, especially one that requires a deep dive into how things *really* work, I'm happy to chat.
