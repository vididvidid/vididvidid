# 👋 I’m Yash Kumar Kasaudhan  

I speak in code and logic.  
I think in systems.  
I solve problems by breaking them down to their core.  

My tools: **C and JavaScript**  
My playground: **the command line**  
My approach: **observe, deduce, build**  

---

## 📖 Philosophy  
I don’t follow trends.  
I ask *why*.  
I believe real solutions come from first principles, not frameworks.  

Code is a craft. Precision matters. Every line should teach me something.  

---

## 👨‍💻 What I Build  
- **Systems & Backends** → efficient, scalable, no fluff  
- **Linux & GTK Apps** → tools that feel native, built with care  
- **Automation & Tooling** → code that saves time and amplifies effort  
- **The Web, from scratch** → Node.js, JavaScript, no frameworks. Just understanding  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies I Wield  
- **C & C++** → precision and performance  
- **JavaScript / Node.js** → building for the modern web  
- **GTK & GLib/GObject** → shaping the Linux desktop  
- **Linux & Shell** → my natural environment  
- **TypeScript** → exploring structure and scale  
- **WebAssembly** → bringing C power to the web  

---

## 🚀 Beyond Code  
I compete (ICPC).  
I contribute (Linux, GNOME, open source).  
I build things that matter.

If you’re building something hard—  
something that demands clarity and precision—  
**let’s talk.**
